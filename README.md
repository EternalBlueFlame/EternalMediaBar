This source is intended for development of Eternal Media Bar so that users may observe the progress of the program's development, report problems, request features, and even contribute directly to the development.

<strong>This project requires Android Studio 1.5 or later<br/>
The application is intended for all android devices 4.0.3 and later, however currently has only been tested on 5.0, 6.0 and 4.0.3 in x86, ARMv7, and ARMv9</strong>

<strong><h3>WARNING: save files have changed between every build of RC1. If you are upgrading from a previous build, please clear the data of the app.</h3></strong>
This can be done in your settings menu, under the apps category.
Failing to do so will lead to crashing, instability, and/or missing shortcuts.

<strong>APK builds will be generated after each new feature is added, assuming it appears stable.</strong>

<h2> About us</h2>
Eternal: I am a hobbyist programmer of over 8 years, I mainly use C# in Unity 3D to create games and tools, but I have an Android Launcher project in Java that I try and keep up, alongside working on my other programs. Sometimes a bit on an extrovert, as you will usually see on my blog.

Lunar Tales is my protégé, she is the one behind the graphics, whether it's making them directly, or helping me get things just right. Skilled in XHTML/CSS I hope to teach her, through our projects, other programming languages later down the road.

We love to see people contribute to our projects, any and all issues, pull requests, and ideas will be reviewed, and even if we don't use your submission directly, it may help the project in other ways.

<h2>Project Goals:</h2>

<strong>Constant Goals:</strong>
-	Anything that will improve performance for CPU, GPU, and/or RAM takes a priority, even if it's a seemingly miniscule amount.
-	Stability takes the biggest priority.
-	Security of user information takes priority.
</hr>
<hr>
<strong>RC2 Plans:</strong>
-	if you plugin headphones or a controller it will automatically change to the approporate menu.
-	Create a new set of icons, and a list item background for highlight. The design of the current ones are fine, but they are nowhere near as crisp or clear as necessary.
-	app boot animation overlay (plays an android boot animation while the app you want to use loads in the background).
-	auto app organizer using an XML parse of the google store's website (probably offload to an async task so the progress can be measured and a loading screen can be given to the user).
-	custom wallpaper for selected app from file, if file exists (use an async task).
-	listview scroll snapping.
-	List organizer, allow users to manually change positions of apps in the list, and sort them alphabetically (EMB apps stay topmost).
-	extra settings:
-	change icon color //hmenu only
-	change menu background color //effects icon background and slide out menu color.
-	enable/disable custom app backgrounds.
-	download app backgrounds from google play (xml parse).
-	un-hide hidden apps //selective menu.
-	enable manufacturer icons //same as google icons, but instead uses the icons from HTC/Samgsung/Sony/etc apps.
-	disable app boot animation.
-	expanded manual organization of lists.
-	organization grouping dependant on developer //combines with other organization methods
-	organize by date installed/updated //highly dependant on how the OS handles this sort of thing
</hr>
<hr>
<strong>RC3 plans:</strong>
-	User defined app/menu icons?
-	Widgets in the scroll list, or on the side?
-	built in music player //Separate activity for player //Separate activity for background player.
-	save custom themes to file for sharing?
</hr>
<hr>
<strong>RC4 plans:</strong>
-	built in video player. //Built off VLC? //Separate Activity.
-	Google Play Release?
-	root checker.
-	CPU max clock control for root users.
-	max clock control able to be changed per app.
-	Gaming mode, toggle, High battery drain warning. always max CPU frequency when on.
