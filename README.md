<h2> About us</h2>
Eternal: I am a hobbyist programmer of over 8 years, I mainly use C# in Unity 3D to create games and tools, but I have an Android Launcher project in Java that I try and keep up, alongside working on my other programs. Sometimes a bit on an extrovert, as you will usually see on my blog.

Lunar Tales is my protégé, she is the one behind the graphics, whether it's making them directly, or helping me get things just right. Skilled in XHTML/CSS I hope to teach her, through our projects, other programming languages later down the road.

We love to see people contribute to our projects, any and all issues, pull requests, and ideas will be reviewed, and even if we don't use your submission directly, it may help the project in other ways.
